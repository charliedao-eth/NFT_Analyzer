# NFT Analyzer

NFT Analytics Toolkit for sales, community, and social media insights on NFTs.

## Proposed workflow

1. Collect raw datasets.
2. Transform raw data to satisfy schema constraints.
3. Write analytic function using schema-passing data as input.

The proposed workflow ensures new NFT collection data is compatible with our analytics.
